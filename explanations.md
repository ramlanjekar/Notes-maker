## NGS Data Analysis Explained:

*   **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Reads are obtained from a sequencer.
    *   Data exists in various formats.

*   **Quality Control (QC):**
    *   **A. Evaluation:** Assess the quality of the sequencing data.
    *   **B. Pre-processing:** Clean and filter the data to improve accuracy.

*   **Read Mapping:**
    *   Align reads to a reference sequence.
    *   **Applications:**
        *   **Genome analysis:** Identify variants (SNP, Indel, SV).
        *   **Transcriptome analysis:** Study gene expression.
        *   **Epigenomic studies:** Analyze epigenetic modifications.

*   **Read Assembly:**
    *   Construct a new reference genome from the reads.
